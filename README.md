POPForums Sample
================

This is a sample project showing how to light up POP Forums in an ASP.NET app by way of package references. For the backend, you need at a minimum these NuGet packages:  

https://www.nuget.org/packages/PopForums.Mvc/  
https://www.nuget.org/packages/PopForums.Sql/  

You'll also need this NPM package:  

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popworldmedia/popforums   

The included gulpfile.js copies the client files as necessary. You also need the `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` layout. Check the main project for options for the `appsettings.json` file and the `Program.cs` file.
